  <p>
    Medical malpractice is often discussed in terms of how frequently cases occur,
    but frequency alone does not capture the seriousness of patient harm.
    This data brief examines whether states with more malpractice cases also experience
    more severe outcomes, or whether severity follows a different pattern altogether.
  </p>

  <p>
    Using national malpractice payment data, the analysis focuses on the share of cases
    involving severe harm, defined as death or permanent injury. The visualizations
    below explore geographic variation, extremes in severity, and the relationship
    between case volume and harm.
  </p>

  <h2>Geographic variation in malpractice severity</h2>

  <iframe class="viz" src="malpractice_severity_map.html"></iframe>
  <div class="caption">
    Map showing the share of malpractice payment reports involving severe harm by state.
  </div>

  <p>
    Severity is not evenly distributed across the country. Some states report a much
    higher proportion of cases involving severe harm, while others cluster at the lower
    end. Importantly, this map reflects shares rather than raw counts, allowing for
    comparisons that are not driven solely by population size.
  </p>

  <div class="caption">

  </div>

  <p>
    States at the top of the distribution show that a majority of malpractice cases
    involve severe outcomes. However, high severity shares do not necessarily imply
    a large number of total cases. Some states appear here despite having relatively
    modest malpractice volumes.
  </p>

  <div class="caption">

  </div>

  <p>
    At the other end of the spectrum, these states report substantially lower shares
    of severe harm. The contrast with the highest-severity states highlights how
    malpractice outcomes vary even when cases are formally defined in similar ways.
  </p>

  <h2>Malpractice volume and severity are not the same</h2>

  <iframe class="viz" src="mirror_malpractice_volume_severity.html"></iframe>
  <div class="caption">
    Mirrored stacked bars showing total malpractice cases split into severe and non-severe harm
    for the ten states with the highest case volume.
  </div>

  <p>
    This mirrored view separates case volume from case severity. States with the most
    malpractice reports are not always those with the highest proportion of severe harm.
    In several cases, non-severe outcomes dominate the volume even when total case counts
    are high.
  </p>

  <p>
    The visualization makes clear that volume-driven narratives can obscure meaningful
    differences in patient outcomes.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <!-- ========================= -->
  <!-- Scatterplot -->
  <!-- ========================= -->

  <h2>Is severity associated with volume?</h2>

  <iframe class="viz" src="scatterplot_malpractice_volume_vs_severity.html"></iframe>
  <div class="caption">
    Scatterplot of total malpractice payment reports versus the share involving severe harm.
  </div>

  <p>
  To directly test the relationship between volume and severity, this scatterplot compares
  total malpractice cases with the share involving severe harm for each state.
  While the fitted trend line slopes slightly upward, the relationship is weak.
</p>

<p>
  Regression results confirm this visual pattern. The correlation between malpractice
  case volume and severity is small and statistically insignificant
  (Pearson r = 0.13, p = 0.35), indicating no meaningful association between how many
  cases a state reports and how severe those cases are.
</p>

<p>
  In other words, states with more malpractice cases are not systematically more severe.
  Severity appears to be driven by factors beyond sheer case volume.
</p>

  <!-- ========================= -->
  <!-- Conclusion -->
  <!-- ========================= -->

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
  Taken together, these visualizations show that malpractice severity and malpractice
  volume capture different dimensions of risk. Geographic patterns, distributional
  extremes, and state-level comparisons all point to the same conclusion:
  a higher number of cases does not necessarily imply more severe patient outcomes.
</p>

<p>
  At the same time, this analysis is subject to important limitations. The data are
  aggregated at the state level and do not distinguish between medical specialties,
  clinical settings, or types of procedures. As a result, observed differences in
  severity may reflect variation in case mix rather than differences in underlying
  quality of care or institutional risk.
</p>

<p>
  The regression analysis further highlights these constraints. With only total case
  volume included as an explanatory variable, the estimated relationship between volume
  and severity is weak and statistically insignificant. This specification leaves
  substantial omitted variable bias on the table, as severity is likely influenced by
  factors such as patient demographics, hospital characteristics, legal environments,
  reporting practices, and specialty-specific risk profiles that are not captured here.
</p>

<p>
  For policymakers and healthcare practitioners, these findings suggest caution.
  Policies focused solely on reducing malpractice volume may overlook contexts where
  patient harm is disproportionately severe. Future research would benefit from more
  granular data that links malpractice outcomes to clinical fields, institutional
  characteristics, and legal or regulatory environments to better explain why severity
  varies across states.
</p>
<h2>Data Sources and Citations</h2>

<p>
  The primary data used in this analysis come from the National Practitioner Data Bank
  (NPDB), which records medical malpractice payment reports submitted by insurers,
  healthcare institutions, and practitioners across the United States. Severity is
  defined based on reported patient outcomes, including death or permanent injury,
  as classified by the NPDB.
</p>

<p>
  All analyses and visualizations were produced by the author using publicly available
  NPDB data aggregated at the state level. Statistical analysis, including correlation
  estimates and ordinary least squares regression, was conducted in Python.
